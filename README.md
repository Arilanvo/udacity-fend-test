# Landing Page Project

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Development Strategy

- at first I've used the skeleton given by udacity but then I've decided to build from scratch because I felt this will be more comfy to me than being confused between two codes mine and the original.

"I've built the responsive navbar and used Javascript to create eventlistener for scrolling and click highlighting."

- sorry I'm not experienced to be able to work under intensive pressure of two codes mixed.

- finally, I've decided to merge between my work and skeleton work to improve my skills.

## B.S

- OnClick-Event listener does work by double clicking
